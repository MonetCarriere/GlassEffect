# GlassEffect
This is just for the intent and purpose of showing the glass effect illustration (for my personal archive).

<img width="809" alt="glass-example" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52170550/216488032-afd9157f-8d59-4e79-b7d3-001b1ccb1159.png">

This was acheived with just 15 lines of code. 

In the html file, I just had a div with a class of container.

The css had the following: 

<img width="616" alt="glass-css" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52170550/216488312-fe09821a-9415-4958-bad5-a3ce8a742466.png">

Basicaly, to acheive the glass look all you need is a backdrop filter blur on a div. ...That's it.
